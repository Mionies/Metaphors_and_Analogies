So, in the first sentence, comparing chores to a \"sad tune\" is not literal and rather it suggests that the person feels unhappy or unmotivated while doing chores.

This is a metaphor, which is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn't literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison. In this case, the \"course\" isn't literally a balloon ride but the sentence is implying that the course was an enjoyable, effortless and fascinating experience like a balloon ride.\n\n2) The boat trip was a ferry ride.
