Here are the three sentences:\n1) Forgiveness is a cookie\n2) A tasty thing is a cookie\n3) A couch is a cookie\n\nPlease provide the answer in separate lines for each sentence. [/INST] Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. The sentence is not to be taken literally, as forgiveness is not a physical object that can be compared to a cookie. Instead, the sentence is using \"cookie\" as a metaphor to convey a concept related to forgiveness, such as something that is comforting or soothing.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. A tasty thing can be any object or substance that has a pleasing flavor. Since a cookie is a type of food that is often enjoyed for its taste, the sentence is accurately describing a \"tasty thing\" as a cookie.\n\nSentence 3) is anomalous.
