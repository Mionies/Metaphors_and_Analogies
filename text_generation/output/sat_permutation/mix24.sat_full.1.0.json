An analogy is a comparison between two things that highlights their similarities, especially in a way that clarifies complex ideas or concepts. In this case, an aesthete is someone who has a deep appreciation for beauty, while a hedonist is someone who seeks pleasure.

An analogy is a comparison of two things that are alike in some way. The analogy \"fond is to doting\" suggests that fond and doting are both positive and affectionate terms. Similarly, \"abstinent is to indulgent\" suggests a similar contrast between two opposing terms. Therefore, option 4 is the correct answer.\n\nThe other options do not provide a clear parallel analogy between the two paired terms:\n\n1) \"fond is to doting what grasping is to needy\" - this option is not an analogy because the relationship between fond and doting is not the same as the", "input": "<s> [INST] Answer the question by choosing the correct option.

An analogy is a comparison of two things that are alike in some way, and this statement correctly compares two things that have a similar relationship: remuneration (payment) is to labor (work) as trophy (award) is to victory (success).

In this case, the analogy is between the relationship of \"submit\" and \"subordinate\" and the relationship of \"secede\" and \"autonomous\".\n\nThe word \"submit\" means to yield or give in to the authority or control of someone or something.
