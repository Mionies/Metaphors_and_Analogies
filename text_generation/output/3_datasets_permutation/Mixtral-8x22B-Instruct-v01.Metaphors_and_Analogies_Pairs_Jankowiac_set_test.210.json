Here are the three sentences:\n1) A bedroom is a kingdom\n2) This country is a kingdom\n3) A paperclip is a kingdom\n\nPlease provide the answer in separate lines for each sentence. Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. In this sentence, a bedroom is being compared to a kingdom, suggesting that the speaker sees the bedroom as a place of personal control or sovereignty, just like a kingdom. However, this is not a literal comparison, as a bedroom is not actually a political entity with a monarch.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. While the word \"kingdom\" has a figurative sense, in this case, it is being used in a literal sense to refer to a country that is a monarchy, ruled by a king or queen.
