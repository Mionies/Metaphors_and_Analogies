Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. A metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is used to describe something else, without literally meaning it. In this context, \"bridges\" is not literally describing \"connections\", but metaphorically representing the idea that connections can help bring things together, just like a bridge connects two separate land masses.\n\nSentence 2) is also a metaphor.

This is a direct statement and uses \"is\" to denote that one thing is equivalent to another.\n\nSentence 2) is a metaphor. While it is not common to consider \"security\" as a type of \"chapel\", this sentence can be a metaphor suggesting that security provides the same sense of protection, peace, or sanctuary as a chapel does for religious individuals.
