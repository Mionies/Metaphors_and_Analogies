There is exactly one anomalous sentence, one metaphor, and one literal sentence among the three provided sentences. Here are the three sentences:\n1) sugar is to coffee what honey is to tea\n2) sugar is to coffee what incentive is to deal\n3) sugar is to coffee what grinder is to bean\n\nPlease provide the answer in separate lines for each sentence. [/INST] Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. The sentence compares sugar in coffee to honey in tea, implying that sugar plays a similar role in coffee as honey does in tea.\n\nSentence 2) is anomalous. The comparison is not logical as sugar is a sweetener while incentive is a stimulus to encourage a particular action or work.\n\nSentence 3) is literal. This comparison is factually accurate and describes the relationship between a grinder and a bean. Grinders are used to process and break down beans into a fine texture, suitable for brewing coffee."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"anomalous\", which one is \"literal\", and which one is a \"metaphor\".

[/INST] Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. It implies that a thermometer measures temperature in the same way that a barometer measures pressure.\n\nSentence 2) is anomalous. A thermometer measures temperature, not honesty. A polygraph measures a person's physiological response to questions, which is thought to indicate lying or truth-telling, but it does not actually measure honesty directly.\n\nSentence 3) is literal.

However, the sentence implies that there is a connection between the signal (carrying information) and the wire (the medium for the information).\nSentence 3) is anomalous because a conductor's role is not limited to blowing whistles.
