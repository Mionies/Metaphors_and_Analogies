An analogy demonstrates the relationship or connection between two sets of things. In this case, an analogy should illustrate the relationship between choreography and dance as well as between ceremony and sermon. Both choreography and dance have something in common, in that choreography is the process of arranging dance movements.

An analogy is a comparison of two things that are alike in some way. In this analogy, \"lubricate\" is to \"smoothly\" as \"absorb\" is to \"quickly.\" Both pairs of words express a relationship between a verb and an adverb, where the adverb describes the manner in which the action is performed.
