[/INST] Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor.\n\nSentence 2) is a literal sentence.\n\nSentence 3) is an anomalous sentence.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor because it is comparing the role of sugar in coffee to the role of incentive in a deal, suggesting that one is as essential to the other as sugar is to coffee.\n\nSentence 2) is a literal sentence because it is a direct comparison of two things that are similar to each other. Sugar is to coffee what honey is to tea, meaning they both serve the same function in their respective drinks.\n\nSentence 3) is an anomalous sentence because it is not a valid comparison."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"anomalous\", which one is \"literal\", and which one is a \"metaphor\".

In this case, a thermometer measures temperature in the same way that a polygraph measures honesty (by detecting changes in body temperature, for example).\n\nSentence 2) is literal because it accurately describes the relationship between two things that are directly related to each other. A thermometer measures temperature, and a barometer measures pressure, so the relationship between them is straightforward.\n\nSentence 3"}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"anomalous\", which one is \"literal\", and which one is a \"metaphor\".

[/INST] Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. The relationship between a train and track is being compared to a signal and wire, which is not a direct comparison but rather an analogy to illustrate a concept or idea.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. It describes a direct relationship between a train and its track, as well as a trolley and its rail.\n\nSentence 3) is anomalous.
