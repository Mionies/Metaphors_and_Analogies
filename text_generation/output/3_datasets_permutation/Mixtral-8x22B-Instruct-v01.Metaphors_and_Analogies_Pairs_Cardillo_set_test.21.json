Here are the two sentences:\n1) His foul mood was a vortex.\n2) The black hole was a vortex.\n\nPlease provide the answer in separate lines for each sentence.[/INST] Answer: Sentence 1) is a metaphor. In this sentence, a person's foul mood is being compared to a vortex, which is not literally possible. A vortex is a swirling mass of fluid or air, while a foul mood is an emotional state. The sentence is using figurative language to make a comparison and is therefore not meant to be taken literally.\n\nSentence 2) is a literal sentence. A black hole can create a vortex-like effect called frame dragging, where the space and time surrounding the black hole are dragged along with its rotation. Therefore, in this sentence, the word \"vortex\" is being used literally to describe the physical phenomenon."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you two sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"literal\" and which one is a \"metaphor\".

It is not literally possible for a home purchase to be a bungee jump, as they are completely different things. However, the sentence is using the idea of a bungee jump (an exhilarating and potentially risky activity) to describe the process of buying a home.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. It is possible for a fence to be a high jump, as it can be a physical obstacle that someone might need to jump over. There is no metaphorical interpretation of this sentence."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you two sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"literal\" and which one is a \"metaphor\".

The phrase \"The reception was an elitist sashay\" uses the term \"elitist sashay\" as a metaphor to describe the atmosphere or nature of the reception. It suggests that the reception was exclusive, fancy, or pretentious, much like an elegant \"sashay\" (a strut or walk) by an elite group.\n\nSentence 2) is a literal sentence. The phrase \"The procession was a swift sashay\" is literal, as it describes the procession as a \"sashay\", or a type of walk or movement, that is being done quickly or swiftly. In this case, the word \"sashay\" is used"}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you two sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"literal\" and which one is a \"metaphor\".

The statement \"His headache was a drum\" is a metaphor because a headache is not literally a drum, but the description is used to convey the intensity or rhythmic nature of the pain.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. The statement \"The purchase was a drum\" is literal if the purchase was indeed a drum, meaning someone bought a drum. If the statement is used figuratively, such as to say the purchase was costly (like a drum), then it would also be a metaphor. However, based on the provided information, the literal interpretation applies."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you two sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"literal\" and which one is a \"metaphor\".
