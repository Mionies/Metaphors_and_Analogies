      "Explanation: This sentence is comparing two different weather phenomena, blizzard and monsoon, to their respective smaller parts, snowflake and raindrop, implying that a blizzard is to a snowflake as a monsoon is to a raindrop. Although blizzards and monsoons are very different phenomena, they are both weather events that involve a large amount of precipitation, and snowflakes and raindrops are both individual parts of those events. Therefore, the sentence is using a metaphor to compare two different things that have some similarities.\n",

      "The reason for this is that, in the context of the analogy provided, the object \"kneepad\" should have a corresponding object that performs a similar function for another body part. An \"elbowpad\" could function as a counterpart to a \"kneepad\", but the equivalence stated in the sentence implies that a \"kneepad\" serves the same purpose for the elbow as it does for the knee when, in fact, the elbow has its own distinct protective gear, which is an \"elbow pad\".

Sentence 3 does not make sense in this context, as \"elbow\" and \"elbowpad\" are not related in the same way that \"knee\" and \"kneepad\" are, so it is anomalous. \n",
