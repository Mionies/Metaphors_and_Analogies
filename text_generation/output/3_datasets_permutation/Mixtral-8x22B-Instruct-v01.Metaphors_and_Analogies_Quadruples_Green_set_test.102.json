Here are the three sentences:\n1) sugar is to coffee what honey is to tea\n2) sugar is to coffee what grinder is to bean\n3) sugar is to coffee what incentive is to deal\n\nPlease provide the answer in separate lines for each sentence. Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a literal sentence. This sentence is comparing two similar relationships - sugar enhances coffee's flavor in the same way as honey sweetens tea's taste.\n\nSentence 2) is the anomalous sentence. This sentence is comparing sugar, which is added to coffee, to a grinder - a tool used to grind beans. They are not related in a similar context like the other sentences.\n\nSentence 3) is a metaphor. This sentence is using a metaphorical comparison between sugar adding flavor to coffee and incentives offering motivation or enticement in a deal. They are not directly related but share an analogy."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"anomalous\", which one is \"literal\", and which one is a \"metaphor\".

Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is literal. This sentence is stating that a thermometer measures temperature in the same way that a barometer measures pressure, which is a factual and literal comparison between two tools.\n\nSentence 2) is anomalous. This sentence is comparing a thermometer to temperature and a table to a leg, which is an anomalous comparison because a table is not a measuring device for legs in the same way that a thermometer is a measuring device for temperature.\n\nSentence 3) is a metaphor. This sentence is comparing a thermometer to temperature and a polygraph to honesty. Polygraphs do not directly measure honesty, rather they measure physiological responses that may indicate deception.

Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is \"literal\" - Both trains and trolleys are vehicles that follow a specific path, in this case, tracks and rails, respectively. Therefore, this sentence is a direct comparison between two similar situations and is considered to be literal.\n\nSentence 2) is a \"metaphor\" - This sentence says that a train is to a track in the same way a conductor is to a whistle, implying that both trains and conductors depend on their respective objects to function properly. While this might hold true for trains and tracks, it is a metaphoric comparison for conductors and whistles, since conductors use whistles but are not dependent on them for movement.\n\nSentence 3) is"}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"anomalous\", which one is \"literal\", and which one is a \"metaphor\".

This sentence is comparing two similar relationships, where the rind of a watermelon and the peel of an orange both serve as protective outer layers.\n\nSentence 2) is a \"metaphor\". This sentence is comparing two dissimilar relationships, as a raspberry is not a protective outer layer like a watermelon rind or an orange peel. Instead, raspberries grow on bushes, which is different from the other two relationships in the sentence.\n\nSentence 3) is \"anomalous\".
