Here are the two sentences:\n1) The last romp was a Latin tango.\n2) The business deal was a hot tango.\n\nPlease provide the answer in separate lines for each sentence.[/INST] Answer: Sentence 1) is a metaphor. The phrase \"The last romp was a Latin tango\" is metaphorical because it uses a dance, specifically a Latin tango, to describe the nature of the event or experience (the \"romp\"). It suggests a passionate, energetic, and perhaps complex interaction.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. The phrase \"The business deal was a hot tango\" is literal because it uses the word \"hot\" to describe the business deal, which could mean that it was intense, heavily negotiated, or exciting. However, it also uses the word \"tango\" to describe the business deal, which in this context could be a literal reference to a specific kind of deal-making process or"}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you two sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"literal\" and which one is a \"metaphor\".

This sentence describes the loud whistle as a boiling kettle, which is a metaphorical comparison, as a whistle cannot literally boil like a kettle.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. This sentence describes the pregnant woman as a boiling kettle, which can be interpreted as a metaphor; however, given that both are experiencing a natural process, it can also be viewed as a literal statement. But since there is exactly one metaphor, this must be the literal one.\n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the interpretation that there is exactly one metaphor, then the sentence \"The pregnant woman was a boiling kettle\" is considered literal, because the"}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you two sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"literal\" and which one is a \"metaphor\".

In this context, \"dodge\" refers to a swift move to avoid something, which is used literally.\nSentence 2) is a metaphor.

It describes a situation where the country border physically coincides with a river. The usage of \"was\" implies a direct one-to-one relation, and rivers can indeed serve as physical borderlines between countries.\n\nSentence 2) is a metaphor. It suggests an analogy between the artist's ideas and a river. However, ideas are abstract and cannot physically resemble or be a river; thus, the sentence is not a literal description but rather a figurative comparison. It implies the artist's ideas can be as vast, dynamic, and unpredictable as a river."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you two sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"literal\" and which one is a \"metaphor\".

The phrase \"Her words were a gentle murmur\" is a metaphor because \"words\" are not a literal \"murmur\" but can metaphorically be described as a \"murmur\" to express their softness and gentleness.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. The phrase \"Her eyelashes were a soft murmur\" is not a metaphor but a nonsensical statement because eyelashes cannot literally be a \"murmur.\" Since it does not employ an imaginative comparison or analogy to make a point, it cannot be considered a metaphor."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you two sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"literal\" and which one is a \"metaphor\".

This sentence is a metaphor because a giggle cannot literally be an answer. Instead, it means the child answered with a giggle as a form of expression.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. Although this sentence might seem like a metaphor, it is not. In this context, \"giggle\" is not referring to the sound of laughter but rather a humorous or amusing thing. When someone says \"His ugly car is a giggle\", it means that the car is so ugly that it is actually funny or amusing to look at. The literal meaning of \"giggle\" in this context is \"something that is amusing or humorous\"."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you two sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"literal\" and which one is a \"metaphor\".

In this sentence, the word \"drum\" is used as a simile to describe the intensity and rhythm of the headache, meaning the headache was severe and persistent, like the sound of a beating drum.
