There is exactly one anomalous sentence, one metaphor, and one literal sentence among the three provided sentences. Here are the three sentences:\n1) sugar is to coffee what incentive is to deal\n2) sugar is to coffee what honey is to tea\n3) sugar is to coffee what grinder is to bean\n\nPlease provide the answer in separate lines for each sentence. Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. This sentence is comparing two different things - sugar to coffee and incentive to deal - using \"is to\" to represent the relationship between them. This is a metaphor because it is not literally saying that sugar is the same thing as coffee, but rather that they have a similar relationship to incentive and deal.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. This sentence is literally saying that sugar is to coffee what honey is to tea, meaning that sugar is often added to coffee just as honey is often added to tea. This is a straightforward comparison that is meant to be taken at face value.\n\nSentence 3) is anomalous. This sentence is not logically consistent because a grinder is a tool"}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"anomalous\", which one is \"literal\", and which one is a \"metaphor\".

Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. This sentence compares a thermometer's relationship to temperature to a polygraph's relationship to honesty, which is not a direct, literal comparison but a metaphorical one based on the idea of measurement and detection.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. This sentence compares a thermometer's relationship to temperature with a barometer's relationship to pressure. Both thermometers and barometers are instruments that measure physical quantities (temperature and atmospheric pressure, respectively), making this a direct, literal comparison.\n\nSentence 3) is anomalous or figurative.

Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. This sentence is comparing \"train to track\" with \"signal to wire\" in a metaphorical sense, implying a relationship between them. However, the comparison is non-literal and used to illustrate a concept or idea.\n\nSentence 2) is literal. This sentence is stating that a train runs on a track, just as a trolley runs on a rail. The relationship is direct and straightforward, with no implied meanings or metaphorical comparisons.\n\nSentence 3) is anomalous. This sentence is not fitting with the other two in terms of its comparison. A train operates on a track, but it is a conductor that operates a whistle, not a"}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"anomalous\", which one is \"literal\", and which one is a \"metaphor\".

Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor. It uses a comparison between two things that are not alike, but have some similarity (both the rind and cigarette butt are often left behind when we consume the main part of the watermelon and cigarette, respectively).\n\nSentence 2) is literal. It is a direct comparison where the rind is to watermelon as peel is to the orange, which states a factual and direct likeness.\n\nSentence 3) is anomalous. It uses an incorrect comparison between the watermelon's rind and a raspberry bush. There is no relatability in this sentence as a watermelon does not have a 'bush' part."}]}
