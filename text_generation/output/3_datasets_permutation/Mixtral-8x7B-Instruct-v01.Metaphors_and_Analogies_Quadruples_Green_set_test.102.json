[/INST] Answer:\n\nSentence 1) is a metaphor.\nExplanation: This sentence is a metaphor because it compares two unlike things (thermometer and barometer) by saying that one (thermometer) is to something (temperature) as the other (barometer) is to something else (pressure). Both thermometer and barometer are instruments that measure something, and the metaphor suggests a similarity between the two.\n\nSentence 2) is anomalous.\nExplanation: This sentence is anomalous because it compares two things that are not comparable (thermometer and table). A table has legs, but a thermometer does not.

This is because the relationship between a train and a track is being compared to the relationship between a trolley and a rail, implying a similarity but not an identical relationship.\n\nSentence 2) is anomalous. In a train-track system, a conductor does not have a direct relationship with the whistle similar to that of a train to a track. The conductor may operate the whistle, but it is not inherently related like the train and track.\n\nSentence 3) is literal. The sentence expresses a direct relationship between a train and a track, just as there is a direct relationship between a signal and a wire."}, {"input": "<s> [INST] I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is \"anomalous\", which one is \"literal\", and which one is a \"metaphor\".
